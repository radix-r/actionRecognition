# Overview

Made using python 3

run: `python3 main.py`

## Approach

I followed the data loader tutorial at https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html 
and attempted to us the neural network and modified main.py files from PA2 to recognize actions frame by frame in given 
data set.
